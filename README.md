# planning-map

AUS TPD Planning / Project Delivery simple mapping application built from scratch using the esri-leaflet library, bootstrap, jQuery, and some other libraries. This project was started in an effort to create a mobile friendly web map to view TxDOT authoritative layers that are hosted on ArcGIS Online. It was also built to test out the esri-leaflet library. The layers have been queried for a custom Austin District view.

This project is not final and I am still testing.
